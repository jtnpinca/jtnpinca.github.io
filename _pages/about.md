Hello there! I am currently a Ph.D. Student at The City College of New York (CCNY) doing research on novel Janus particles. I am generally into understanding the influence of nanoscopic features on microscopic or macroscopic properties! That is a very broad interest, but my interest has taken me down many paths.

My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on asymmetrically adding nanoscopic structures to microparticles to enhance the interfacial properties of the Janus microparticles for surfactant applications.

I have experiences in computational and experimental research for combustion, energy storage, and surfactants, as well as regulatory and safety roles in agrochemical and specialty chemical industries. My interests inspire me to design tools for addressing global challenges, particularly regarding energy and scaling manufacturing.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!
