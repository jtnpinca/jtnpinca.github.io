Hello there! My name is Justin. I am currently a Ph.D. Student at The City College of New York (CCNY) doing research on novel Janus particles. Please pardon the dust. This website is still under construction, so I suggest checking out [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pincajustin) for more information.
